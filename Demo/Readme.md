implicit.py contains the computational implementation of the implicit function theorem

Implicit Testing.ipynb tests that it works correctly

Crandall-Rabinowitz.ipynb shows how we can use the theorem to find bifurcation points

ElasticRodCompBifs.ipynb explores the bifurcation points of a discrete elastic rod model

ElasticRodMaxLen.ipynm investigates how large we can make the problem before it becomes computationally intractable

ElasticRodGravity2.ipynm explores how including gravity affects the bifurcations points when the force has magnitude 2

ElasticRodGravity6.ipynm explores how including gravity affects the bifurcations points when the force has magnitude 6
