# Bifurcations
Year Long Project

This repo contains a computational implementation of the implicit function theorem, and notebooks applying it to finite dimensional problems in bifurcation theory.

For notebooks referenced in the report see the folder Demo; the file implicit.py in this folder contains the computational implementation of the implicit function theorem.

The associated writeup is also included in HolmesMAnBifurcationTheory.pdf, chapters 8, 9 and 12 pertain to the contents of this repository.
